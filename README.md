Currently only featuring `.zshrc`

# `.zshrc`

The scope of it was to be as close as possible to the `fish` shell experience.

Right now it is close but not completely. Currently missing things are:
 - Collapsible prompt (I want to change the PS1 entirely anyway)
 - Better command history handling, with per-directory history and autosuggestions

My `.zshrc` does not depend on `oh-my-zsh` or anything like that. Keep this in mind if you want to use that.

The experience for now is similar (but not equal) to `fizsh`, but eventually I aim to make my experience
closer to the real thing than that one project.

Of course this excludes the prompt.

# Use it and/or do whatever you want with it really

You got a handy dandy `install.sh` for that.
